            My name is Peter P. Zorzenon and I have been working in steel for
            around 22 years. I live and work in Long Island, NY. I have shown in
            galleries such as Elaine Benson's gallery in The Hampton, Saint
            Johns Gallery, Hampton Square Gallery, and a host of others. Write
            ups include NY TIMES interesting study of arrested motion, NEW DAY
            steel sculpture steals show. Daily NEWS the art of big art, Dan's
            paper in the Hampton's moments frozen in steel, Advance paper
            Zorzenon's grace with steel, and many more. To be quite honest the
            art should speak for it self. I work mostly in steel. I own US
            patents for steel products I make. The sculptures I make, are hand
            made with no casting involved, the pieces are cut welded and carved
            in away that brings out a handcrafted sculpture, unlike most
            production type art or multiple casting works. Most of my work is
            large, life size or larger. Examples of these would be eagles with
            seven foot wingspans. My work spans from geometric to total realism,
            colorful to formal. A famous NYC gallery once told me that if I
            stuck to one type of art, he would make me famous. I told him I
            would much rather be happy. In the art world today, they say you
            should date your work of art, I DON'T they say you must have a lot
            to say about your artwork I DON'T my work speaks for itself. The
            Native Americans, never dated their artwork. Africans never dated
            their artwork, but I love it just the same. At the bottom of my
            artwork I always sign with a welded PZ, which is my calling card in
            the art world.
